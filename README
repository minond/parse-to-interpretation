From parsing to interpretation: let's build a language

An understanding of program evaluation can be a truly enlightening thing for a programmer. By breaking down the process to its essence and implement the parsing and interpretation steps for a Lisp, we will explore both the interesting and oddly simple algorithms employed in making a language.

Our Lisp will have familiar characteristics like variables, higher-order functions, conditionals, and lexical scope.
