From parsing to interpretation: let's build a language

An understanding of program evaluation can be a truly enlightening thing for a programmer. By breaking down the (or, a part of) process to its essence and implement, from scratch, the parsing and interpretation steps for a Lisp we'll explore both the interesting and oddly simple algorithms employed in making a language. Our Lisp won't be feature rich, since we only have 50 minutes after all, but it will have familiar characteristics like higher-order functions, loops, and lexical scope.
