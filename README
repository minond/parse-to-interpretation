**From parsing to interpretation: let's build a language**

An understanding of program evaluation can be a truly enlightening thing for a
programmer. By breaking down the process to its essence and implementing the
parsing and interpretation steps for a Lisp, we will explore both the
interesting and oddly simple algorithms employed in making a language.

Our Lisp will have familiar characteristics like variables, higher-order
functions, conditionals, and lexical scope.
